# FeatherMvvm
Inspired by MvvmCross for Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS, this is a basic Mvvm library for WinForms that seeks to channel the ease, structure and 
clarity that simple, robust and predictable databinding brings to apps.

## Components
### 1.Views
FeatherMvvm has a base class for views. This base class inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form thus when you base your views on this, not only do 
you gain extended binding functionality, you also maintain the drag-n-drop form building capabilities in Visual Studio.


Then make some changes to this ReadMe file.

When you are done, click the dropdown arrow next to the save button - that will allow you to commit your changes to a new branch.

## Create a pull request to contribute your changes back into master
Pull requests are the way to move changes from a topic branch back into the master branch.

Click on the **Pull Requests** page in the **CODE** hub, then click "New Pull Request" to create a new pull request from your topic branch to the master branch.

When you are done adding details, click "Create Pull request". Once a pull request is sent, reviewers can see your changes, recommend modifications, or even push follow-up commits.
